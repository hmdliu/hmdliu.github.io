I'm a Computer Science Ph.D. student at [NYU Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/) and [NYU Tandon](https://engineering.nyu.edu/), advised by Professor [Hongyi Wen](https://whongyi.github.io/) in the [MAPS Research Group](https://whongyi.github.io/MAPS-research). Prior to that, I did my undergrad at NYU Shanghai, where I was fortunate to receive research training under the guidance of Professor [Li Guo](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/faculty/directory/li-guo). In 2023, I obtained my B.S. degree (Computer Science major & Math minor) and graduated with the Dean’s Award in Computer Science, Data Science, and Engineering.

My research during undergrad was dedicated to image segmentation tasks. Currently, my research interest lies in **building accessible personalization systems based on multimodal data and large pre-trained models**.

My recent work is about `controllable image generation`.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
