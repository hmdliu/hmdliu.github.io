I'm a Computer Science Ph.D. student at [NYU Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/) and [NYU Tandon](https://engineering.nyu.edu/), advised by Professor [Hongyi Wen](https://whongyi.github.io/) in the [MAPS Research Group](https://whongyi.github.io/MAPS-research). I also work closely with Professor [Shengjie Wang](https://sheng-jie-wang.github.io/). Prior to that, I did my undergrad at NYU Shanghai, where I started my research journey with Professor [Li Guo](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/faculty/directory/li-guo). I obtained my B.S. degree in 2023 and graduated with the Dean’s Award in Computer Science, Data Science, and Engineering.

I'm currently working on investigating and uncovering the hidden dynamics in **deep generative models**, such as Diffusion and LLMs, thereby achieving better **cross-modality alignment** and **personalized services**.

Outside of research, I have a wide range of hobbies, including philosophy, music, language, and divination. (Check out the `Misc` tab! 🤣)

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
